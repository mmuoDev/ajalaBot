            <h2><strong>Privacy Policy</strong></h2>

            <p>AjalaBot is a tourism platform aimed at making it easy for people to enjoy trips/tours. We have prepared this Privacy Policy to describe to you our practices regarding the information we collect from users of our products and services.</p>

            <h3>TYPES OF INFORMATION WE COLLECT</h3><br>

            <h4>PERSONAL INFORMATION</h4>
            <p>
                "Personal Information" means information that allows someone to identify or contact you, including, for example, your name, phone number, e-mail address, gender, and/or additional information that could be used (whether alone or in combination with additional information) to identify you personally.
            </p>

            <h4>INFORMATION YOU PROVIDE US</h4>
            <p>
                We collect Personal Information from you when you register for our Services, as well as when you provide us with any such Personal Information (e.g., when responding to a survey or filling out a form). When registering for our Services, you may be asked to enter your name, phone number, e-mail address, gender, and/or additional information that could be used (whether alone or in combination with additional information) to identify you personally.
            </p>

            <h4>INFORMATION COLLECTED BY OUR SERVERS</h4>

            <p>
                As is true of most online services, we gather certain information automatically and store it in log files. Our servers (which may be hosted by a third-party service provider) collect information from you, including but not limited to information regarding the device and/or software program through which you access our Services (e.g., the hardware model, operating system and version, MAC address, unique device identifier, phone number, and mobile network information), and/or a date/time stamp for your use of our Services.
            </p>

            <h4>RELATIONSHIP WITH SOCIAL NETWORKING SITES</h4>
            <p>
                We created interfaces that allow you to connect your account for our Services with accounts you may have established with third-party apps, messaging platforms and other services (“Third-Party Services”). These interfaces allow you to authorize us to access your account on a Third-Party Service on your behalf. Once authorized by you, the Third-Party Service recognizes us when we ask, on your behalf, for access to your account information or to post information. You should be able to revoke our access to any Third-Party Service at any time by changing the appropriate settings from within your account settings on the applicable Third-Party Service.
            </p>

            <h4>USE OF INFORMATION</h4>

            <p>
                The Personal Information we collect from you may be used in one of the following ways:
            <ul>
                <li>To improve our Services – we continually strive to improve our Services based on the information and feedback we receive from you;</li>
                <li>To improve customer service – your information helps us to more effectively respond to your customer service requests and support needs;</li>
                <li>To market to you our products and services (and those of third parties) that we believe may interest you, and to permit third parties to market such products and services to you;</li>
                <li>To tailor the content and features of the Services to you;</li>
                <li>To improve the quality of the Services;</li>
                <li>To administer a contest, promotion, survey or other feature; and</li>
                <li>To send periodic emails.
                    The email address you provide may be used to send you information, respond to inquiries, and/or other requests or questions.</li>
            </ul>
            </p>

            <h4>SHARING OF INFORMATION</h4>
            <p>
                Your security and privacy is our utmost priority. We do not share any of your information with unauthorized persons and adequate safeguards have been put in place to prevent unauthorized access and to ensure confidentiality of your personal information.
